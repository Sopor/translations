# Workspace for Kodi add-on translators

This repository is a project to unite existing Kodi add-on translators to cooperate on translating Kodi add-ons.

We have seen that many add-ons (even high-profile ones) are not very well translated. And in most cases translating these add-ons is a small effort with a great return for our users. So we hope to improve the current situation by having [translation teams in GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/add-ons/teams/translators) that can be notified of new requests and continuing translation efforts.

If you would like to join a translation team, reach out to **@dagwieers** or **@arvvoid** on GitHub.

If you are an add-on developer and would like to translate your add-on, [open a translation request](https://github.com/add-ons/translations/issues/new?template=translation_request.md&title=Translate+[ADD-ON]).

For more information about this project, [look at our translations Wiki](https://github.com/add-ons/translations/wiki).
